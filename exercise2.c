 * 
 * Create a project that changes the state of 8 leds depending on the state of the switches connected on pin P2.0. 
 * Each time P2_0 is pressed', the LEDs should change their behavior from flash  to  maintain their state.
 *     a) Configure the Simple Keypad and Led Panel virtual peripherals.
 *     b) Simulate, step-by-step, while changing the state of the switches manually.
 * This program should use the microcontroller external interrupt system.
