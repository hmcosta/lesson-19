 * 
 * Make a C program for the C8051F340 that creates a square wave on the P2.2  pin with a frequency of 2KHz. 
 * This program should use the microcontroller interrupt system. Considering that the C8051F340 can use a 
 * time of 1μS for each count of timer 0, what is the best mode of operation to generate this wave that 
 * stays 250μs ON and another 250μs OFF. Simulate and test on the board.
